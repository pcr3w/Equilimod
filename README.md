Equilimod is a modding framework for [Equilinox](http://www.indiedb.com/games/equilinox), the nature simulation game currently being developed by [ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix/). It is designed to make modding as simple as possible, using JavaScript to allow modders to create their own species and biomes.

Currently, Equilimod is still very heavily under development, with many features having been left out for the time being. An early beta release is now available in the Discord server for those who wish to try the framework out. Simply request to be a beta tester to gain access.

There are some examples available in the "Examples" folder, although unfortunately the formatting appears to have been messed up.

## Installation
Equilimod is designed to be very easy to install, requiring only the Jar files for Equilimod and Equilinox.

1. Download the Equilimod file from the official source (when one becomes available).

2. Place the downloaded file in the Equilinox game folder (found in your Steam games folder - typically `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common`), along with the original game file:

3. Rename the Equilinox file to `Equilinox.jar` (on Windows this is `EquilinoxWindows.jar`), and rename the Equilimod file to what the Equilinox file used to be called (`EquilinoxWindows.jar` for Windows, `EquilinoxLinux.jar` for Linux, etc).

4. Launch the game as you would do normally so that Equilimod can set up the initial files. Once you close the game, the Equilinox folder should look something like this:
