# Equilimod
## Please note that I am currently working on the API and will release the API and more wiki content once I feel it has reached a certain standard. The current information here and in the wiki is out of date. 
## Sorry for those who have been waiting for modding; hopefully you won't have to wait much longer.

Equilimod is a modding framework for [Equilinox](http://www.indiedb.com/games/equilinox), the nature simulation game currently being developed by [ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix/). It is designed to make modding as simple as possible, using JavaScript to allow modders to create their own species and biomes.

Currently, Equilimod is still very heavily under development, with many features having been left out for the time being. An early release should be available soon for those who wish to try the framework out.

## Installation
Equilimod is designed to be very easy to install, requiring only the Jar files for Equilimod and Equilinox.

1. Download the Equilimod file from the official source (when one becomes available).

2. Place the downloaded file in a folder, along with the original game file:

3. Run the Equilimod file, selecting the Equilinox file from the popup that displays. When doing this, **make sure that you select the Equilinox file - not the Equilimod file**.

4. All of the necessary game files should have been set up and Equilinox should now have started. If nothing appeared to happen, check that you followed all of the instructions carefully.
